When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- in case when I need to share the files, work remotely or collaborate

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- I need to know and understand what changes have been done to the files
